################## INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING ##################
Building is simple. You can do it using the steps below:
1. Run `chmod +x compileOS`
2. Run `./compileOS`

However, you don't need to run this command if you use the provided `runOS`
command since it is run during the execution of that bash script.

################## INSTRUCTIONS FOR USAGE ##################
Run our OS using the provided `runOS` bash script. This will start the bochs
simulator with the correct code. You can verify that it is working if the
simulator says "Hello World!".


################## BUGS OR DEFICIENCIES ##################
There are no bugs or deficiencies that we currently know of.

################## ADDITIONAL FEATURES ##################
We implemented several behind-the-scenes functions which will make our lives
easier. Firstly, we added a 'print' function which accepts a character array
and an x/y position and prints the character array to that x/y position on the
screen. Secondly, we added a 'clear' function which will clear the entire
screen.

Lastly, we added a handy 'clean' bash script which will clean the directory of
any unnecessary generated files.
